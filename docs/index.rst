This is the documentation for my `example_pkg`, illustrating the
structure and implementation of a python package. This project was created
both to provide an experimental testbed for learning about the various
facilities available for documentation, unit testing, among other features,
and to provide a template upon which to base future projects.

This documentation was built using Sphinx. Some pages (among others) that
were used in the process of building this documentation were from `Read the
Docs`_ and from `Sphinx`_
